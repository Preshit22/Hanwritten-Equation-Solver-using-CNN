**Handwritten Equation Solver using CNN**

This project aims to develop a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to solve handwritten mathematical equations. The model takes an image of a handwritten equation as input and outputs the solution.

**Installation**

To run this project locally, please follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Handwritten-Equation-Solver-using-CNN
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**Usage**

Once the installation is complete, you can use the project as follows:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the project directory and open the "CNN test.ipynb" file.

3. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to load the pre-trained model, preprocess the handwritten equation image, and solve the equation.

**Dataset**

The model used in this project has been trained on a large dataset of handwritten mathematical equations. However, due to licensing restrictions, the dataset is not included in this repository. If you wish to train the model from scratch, you will need to obtain a suitable dataset of handwritten equations and follow the data preprocessing steps outlined in the notebook.
